        <h2>About Liquiface</h2>

        <h3>The idea</h3>
        <p>
            A few years ago we had a FedEx day project in mind when we had an idea: “We've been using Liquibase at our
            company for a while but until now changelog files were edited manually. It would be good to support the
            maintenance of changelog files by a graphical interface. And if we're already using NetBeans, it is
            convenient to have this graphical interface accessed from within NetBeans.”
        </p>

        <h3>What is Liquibase?</h3>
        <p>
            Liquibase is a database version tracking tool. In principle: "We never develop a code without version
            control. Then why not to do this in database development?” Liquibase was developed in Java with an
            open-source code. Database modifications are registered in xml (changelog) files. The database itself
            stores which changes have already been run on it. Liquibase on the one hand is a program that can be run
            to apply the changes on a selected database, while on the other hand it also provides a Java API to manage
            database modifications. Currently it does not have a graphic interface, and that is exactly what we are
            working on right now.
        </p>

        <h3>Why is it called Liquiface?</h3>
        <p>
            If it is a GUI (Graphical User InterFace) to Liquibase, i.e. the "face of Liquibase", what else could we
            call it?
        </p>
